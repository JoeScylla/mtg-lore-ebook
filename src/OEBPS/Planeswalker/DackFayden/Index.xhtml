			<h2>Biography</h2>
			
			<p>Dack Fayden is a human mage from Drakeston, a village on the plane of Fiora. As a youth, Dack and his friend Marsh were adept mages who excelled at their abilities but lacked judgment. One night, their genius got the best of them and they picked a fight with brutes, resulting in the death of Marsh. In that moment, Dack’s spark ignited and he became a Planeswalker.</p>
			<p>Dack soon found he could walk the planes and sought out challenges that could both test his abilities and line his pockets. On the plane of Alkabah, Dack got his hands on a cursed artifact, which resulted in his arrest. By the law of that society, his right hand was stained red, forever branding him a thief. He was eventually able to return to Fiora, but in his absence, another Planeswalker named Sifa Grent had massacred Drakeston and all those Dack cared for.</p>
			<p>Dack then turned to use psychometry—the ability to absorb the magic, memories, and uses of an artifact—to track Sifa. His psychometry allowed him to follow her trail from plane to plane, even through the Blind Eternities. He survived his final encounter with Sifa on Ravnica, and was forced to realize that as a Planeswalker, he could help or hurt more than an average person should be able. Although Dack now considers Ravnica home, he will never forget what happened to his people on Fiora.</p>
