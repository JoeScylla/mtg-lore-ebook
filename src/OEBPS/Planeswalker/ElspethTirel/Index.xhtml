			<h2>Biography</h2>
			
			<p>Born on a plane ruined by strife and darkness, this white mage left home when her Planeswalker spark ignited—and she never returned. Elspeth specializes in community and fortification, wielding spells that build and bolster mighty armies, while protecting them from harm.</p>
			<p>Elspeth wants nothing more than to sheathe her sword for the last time, and find a plane to call home. Violence and destruction have a tendency to follow her, and she is constantly driven to take up arms and wield her defensive magic in the service of those that need her protection.</p>
			<p>Elspeth came to Theros from a war-ravaged plane, hoping to find the one thing that has eluded her—peace. Under the watchful protection of gods, she hoped that Theros would not be in need of guardians like her. But when she arrived, Elspeth was quickly identified as an outsider with powers and skills that further distanced her from the natives of Theros. In the wilderness between two city-states, Elspeth was attacked by a monstrous hydra, which had been responsible for the deaths of countless warriors. Elspeth engaged the hydra alone and, after a bitter fight, emerged triumphant. Afterward, she wanted nothing more than to fade into anonymity.</p>
			<p>But on the Theros, the best laid plans of mortals often come second to those of the gods. Her feat of heroism has captured the attention of Heliod, god of the sun, who seeks to make her his champion.</p>
