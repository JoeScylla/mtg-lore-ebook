			<h2>Biography</h2>
			
			<p>Garruk Wildspeaker is a Planeswalker who wields green magic. His specialty is creature magic: spells that coax abundant mana from the land, summon wild beasts, and unleash the ferocity and power of his summoned creatures. But since being cursed by the Chain Veil, his nature spells have been tainted by black magic.</p>
			<p>Garruk has always been a skilled hunter, and his calling has been a plane-spanning hunt for the hugest and most powerful creatures in the Multiverse. But now his chosen quarry is a fellow Planeswalker: the death-witch Liliana Vess. At their last meeting, Liliana used the power of the Chain Veil artifact to curse Garruk, corrupting his power to summon wild beasts. As the curse takes hold and Garruk's fierce predator-companions become sickly fiends, he finds that he's gaining new, chilling powers of death. This only enrages him more.</p>
			<p>Liliana still carries the Chain Veil, and Garruk won't stop until he's cured of his intolerable death-tainted state. After failing to corner and defeat Liliana Vess on Innistrad, Garruk was captured by a commander of the Gavony Riders named Odric. Accused of a crime he did not commit, Garruk became enraged and escaped his captors. The Curse of the Veil had taken hold.</p>
			<p>Now, Garruk continues his search not just for Liliana, but all Planeswalkers. The curse transforms him into a creature more unrecognizable with every kill. He embraces his newfound darkness and considers every Planeswalker to be his prey.</p>
