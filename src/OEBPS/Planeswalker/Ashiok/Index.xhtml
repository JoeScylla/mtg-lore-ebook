			<h2>Biography</h2>
			
			<p>Ashiok uses fear to terrorize foes with their own darkest, most closely guarded nightmares. Ashiok delights in having the upper hand and watching enemies reduced to quaking cowards.</p>
			<p>Because all sentient beings feel fear, Ashiok believes this power is the great equalizer. For Ashiok, fear is a feeling given form by the mindâ€”a quasi-elemental force that can be shaped and wielded to Ashiok's benefit.</p>
			<p>Once Ashiok's Planeswalker spark ignited, it was discovered that in addition to culling the nightmares of others, Ashiok could also make their fears manifest in reality. As such, Ashiok embodies the role of a dark engineer, constructing twisted architectures of torment and sorrow. The dread vapors that emanate from Ashiok are an extension of this magic, enabling easy access and manipulation of the fears of those they enshroud.</p>
			<p>Ashiok now travels the Multiverse in search of designs for the perfect embodiment of fear. In this search, Ashiok came to Theros, where dreams seem more vibrant than the other planes Ashiok has visited.</p>
