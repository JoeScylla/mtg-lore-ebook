			<h2>Biography</h2>
			
			<p>Ugin, the Spirit Dragon is a Planeswalker, and he is ancient beyond measure. His long life has given him a unique perspective on the Multiverse; he sees it as an unbroken whole and seeks to understand its deepest mysteries. He has studied the energetic patterns of entire planes–their creation, destruction, and renewal–and he has applied these universal principles to creating his own form of magic. Ugin's magic deals with the transmutation of matter into energy, and it is a power that can be wielded by all.</p>
			<p>The Eldrazi are another enigma that Ugin has dedicated his life to understanding. He has tracked and documented these great titans in an attempt to comprehend their purpose and nature, and has frowned upon any who have sought to destroy them. Working with the Planeswalkers Sorin Markov and Nahiri, the Lithomancer, the three trapped the Eldrazi on Zendikar. Eventually, Ugin returned to Tarkir to continue his research on his unique form of magic.</p>
			<p>Over a thousand years ago, Ugin ran afoul of the ancient and evil dragon Planeswalker Nicol Bolas. Though it is unknown why the two battled to the death, they fought each other in the skies of Tarkir. This fight would be the most important event in Tarkir's history. Bolas defeated Ugin and left the plane. As one Planeswalker had been his end, another would be Ugin's salvation. The dragon shaman Planeswalker Sarkhan Vol found a way to travel back in time to this pivotal event and save Ugin's life using one the very hedrons the dragon had made on Zendikar.</p>
