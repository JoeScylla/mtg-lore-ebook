			<h2>Biography</h2>
			
			<p>There is no virtue in subtlety-at least not as far as Chandra Nalaar is concerned. She's a confident, ardent, defiant Planeswalker whose specialty is pyromancy: spells of fire, fire, and more fire.</p>
			<p>Growing up as a magic-user on a plane of inventors, she's used to being the black sheep. In fact, she learned to embrace and celebrate her independence through the example set by her renegade parents. But she and her parents were hunted by the local consuls for transgressions against the Consulate's oppressive rule. Her parents were brutally punished, and Chandra herself was sentenced to execution for crimes she didn't commit. Outraged, panicked, and grief-stricken, Chandra's spark ignited along with her pyromancy, and she bathed her punishers in flames before being transported to a new plane. Believing her parents to be dead, Chandra felt lost and alone until she was welcomed into an order of monks, pyromancers like herself, who taught her how to channel her impulses and control her gift.</p>
			<p>Now Chandra uses her pyromantic talents in ways she never could have imagined. She took an oath to protect and defend and joined a group of Planeswalkers known as the Gatewatch. Together with Gideon Jura, Jace Beleren, Liliana Vess, and Nissa Revane, she travels the planes of the Multiverse, battling monstrous threats and fighting for freedom.</p>
