			<h2>Biography</h2>
			
			<p>Angrath the Flame-Chained is a minotaur Planeswalker. In a cruel twist of fate, a planeswalking mishap took him to Ixalan, where of course he has been trapped ever since, unable to planeswalk away. Turned away from the Sun Empire and assaulted by the River Heralds, Angrath finally found a home among the pirates of the Brazen Coalition when Captain Radcliff of the notorious Devil's Smile offered him a place in his crew. Welcomed among the other misfits and rogues of a particularly motley crew, Angrath put his physical and magical talents to good use in Captain Radcliff 's raiding and pillaging. Soon it was clear that the rest of the crew loved and respected Angrath more than their captain, and the minotaur led a quick and almost bloodless mutiny that left Radcliff hanging by a gaff hook strapped to the bowsprit. Now-Captain Angrath changed the ship's name to Devil's Chains to reflect the magic of his searing-hot chains, and the crew's notoriety increased exponentially.</p>
			<p>Angrath is driven by a feeling of restless impatience, like a caged animal awaiting its moment of freedom. This fuels his wild temper and spurs him on in an endless series of raids upon the coastal towns of the Sun Empire. His aggression is wholeheartedly supported byhis crew. Angrath continually sets his sights on the next biggest thing—but he is never satisfied when he acquires it. In one of his recent raids, he faced off against a human warrior of the Sun Empire. As they battled, he was impressedby her skill but still utterly confident of his victory. As the killing blow approached and desperation grew in her eyes,she was suddenly engulfed in a field of glowing energy he recognized—it was the same magic that had balked him every time he had tried to planeswalk away from this infernal prison. Shocked at finally meeting another Planeswalker, he spared the woman's life and retreated, for the first time he could remember. But he was sure he would see her again; their destinies must be intertwined.</p>
			<p>Eventually Angrath learned that the woman, Huatli, had gone off seeking a golden city, in pursuit of the Immortal Sun—the greatest treasure the world had ever known. This treasure, Angrath was sure, was fated to be his; why else would he be marooned on this world? The fact that the other powerful warrior was pursuing it just made it all the more desirable.</p>
