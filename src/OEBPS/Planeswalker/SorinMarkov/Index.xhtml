			<h2>Biography</h2>
			
			<p>There is more at stake on Tarkir than the fate of Sarkhan and the clans. Elsewhere, the world-devouring entities known as the Eldrazi have arisen to feed on the planes of the Multiverse, and the key to stopping them may lie on Tarkir.</p>
			<p>The vampire Planeswalker Sorin Markov was one of three Planeswalkers who trapped the Eldrazi on the plane of Zendikar thousands of years ago, the other two being the Lithomancer and Ugin, the spirit dragon. Now that the Eldrazi have awakened once more, Sorin is on a mission to reunite with these Planeswalkers.</p>
			<p>But the Lithomancer's whereabouts are unknown, and Sorin has not encountered Ugin for over a thousand years. In an attempt to track Ugin down, Sorin has traveled to Tarkir, where the spirit dragon formed an important part of the planar ecosystem.</p>
			<p>In one version of history, Sorin found Ugin's bones in an icy chasm on Tarkir. But in the altered timeline created by Sarkhan Vol, Ugin is alive, encased in a protective cocoon for many centuries. Sorin's quest to find Ugin ends in success, and the two agree to combat the Eldrazi menace together on Zendikar.</p>
