			<h1>Nahiri</h1>
			
			<h2>Biography</h2>
			
			<p>The kor Planeswalker Nahiri was a master of the stoneforge technique, using magic to coax exquisitely crafted weapons and tools fully formed from ordinary rock. After her ascension to Planeswalker status, many knew her simply as "the Lithomancer." Along with two other Planeswalkers—the vampire Sorin Markov and the spirit dragon Ugin—she trapped the monstrous, world-devouring Eldrazi on her home world of Zendikar. With her power over stone, she created the extensive network of floating stone hedrons on the plane—a vital component in the effort to contain the Eldrazi threat. For centuries, Nahiri served as Zendikar's guardian, ensuring that the Eldrazi remained in confinement and swiftly addressing any other threats that arose.</p>
