			<h2>Biography</h2>
			
			<p>The merfolk Planeswalker Kiora, a native of Zendikar, has been traveling the planes to strengthen her connection to the oceans' magic. Her home has been ravaged by the Eldrazi swarm, and she believes that only by summoning the fierce krakens, serpents, and other terrors of the deep can she defeat the titans who now rule Zendikar.</p>
			<p>Kiora has come to Theros in search of the immense sea creatures that dwell here. Shortly after she arrived, she raised up an enormous wave to call to the ocean beasts. The wave smashed against the shore near Meletis and caused considerable damage. It also alerted the tritons, Theros's native merfolk, to a new power in their realm.</p>
			<p>Some tritons believe that Kiora is an avatar or herald of Thassa, god of the sea. Kiora does not disabuse them of this notionâ€”in fact, she rather enjoys the attention. Thassa, however, might take offense if Kiora continues to appropriate her proper worship.</p>
