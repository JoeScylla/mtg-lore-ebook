			<h2>Biography</h2>
			
			<p>Ajani Goldmane is torn between his leonin ferocity and his sense of justice. He was born on Naya and became an outcast within his own family, an albino leonin never accepted by the rest of his pride. The only person who cared about him was his brother Jazal, the leader of their pride and Ajani's inspiration. Ajani had always shown potential as a mage and healer, but had assumed his main calling was to be a warrior in Jazal's service. The day that Ajani's brother was assassinated by unknown forces was the day that Ajani's Planeswalker spark ignited, and everything changed.</p>
			<p>No longer could Ajani worry about his problems with his pride. His quest to discover his brother's killer has led him into a tangle of intrigue woven by mysterious forces, forcing him to broaden his skills as a warrior and to unlock new potential within himself. After thwarting Nicol Bolas's plans on Alara, Ajani set aside his anger and began to travel the Multiverse. He became a mentor to leonin communities on many planes, including Theros.</p>
			<p>While on Theros, Ajani set out to find his old friend, Elspeth. With the help of King Brimaz, he searched the plane for the woman who had become known as the Hydra Killer. When he finally found Elspeth, the situation was far more dangerous than he could have imagined. The gods blamed Elspeth for the unstable state of the world. To set things right, Ajani and Elspeth journeyed into Nyx and battled Xenagos. Elspeth killed the God of Revels, but with dire consequences; she was fatally wounded by the god Heliod. Though Theros was restored to its natural state, Ajani was furious with the gods for what they did to his friend.</p>
			<p>Seeking a place to grieve, Ajani journeyed to Kamigawa and to the home of his friend Tamiyo. There he mourned the loss of Elspeth and began to heal. He learned from Tamiyo of the horrors that the Planeswalker Tezzeret committed against the innocent. Unwilling to allow such a man to cause more pain, Ajani set out to track him down, traveling to the plane on which the artificer was last seen: Kaladesh.</p>
