			<h1>Ixalan</h1>
			
			<figure><img alt="Ixalan" src="Images/VDMJ9HLdtU.jpg" /></figure>
			<p>Deep in the heart of Ixalan’s verdant jungle lies a treasure beyond imagining. Secure in the ancient golden city of Orazca, the Immortal Sun is an artifact of mythic power that promises boundless wealth, the strength of empire, command over nature, and eternal life. For centuries it was only dimly remembered, veiled in legend, but now legend has become reality, and all the peoples of Ixalan seek the Immortal Sun and the power it promises. They will stop at nothing to claim it for their own.</p>
			<p>The merfolk of the River Heralds and the humans of the Sun Empire have shared the continent of Ixalan for ages, sometimes warring, sometimes in an uneasy peace. But outsiders—first the treasure-hungry pirates of the Brazen Coalition and now the sinister fleets of the Legion of Dusk—have disrupted that delicate balance of power. And as the Legion of Dusk seeks to conquer Ixalan, all four peoples are catapulted into a desperate search for the golden city and the treasure it holds.</p>
			<p>A whole world waits to be discovered. Ancient ruins from the Sun Empire’s heyday can now be found, overgrown and half-buried, in the depths of the jungle. Sacred springs infused with magical power well up from high mountainsides. Hidden coves hold pirate treasures stowed by captains long forgotten. Brave explorers from all four peoples uncover such sites as they scour Ixalan in search of the golden city.</p>

But Azor was a Planeswalker, and his deeds across the Multiverse include much more than just his work on Ravnica. Numerous ancient civilizations on many different planes have legends of a “lawbringer” figure, often winged and viewed as a god or semidivine being, and those legends can often be traced back to Azor's influence. On Ixalan, though, Azor sacrificed his spark to create the Immortal Sun.</p>

				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/OrazcaTtheGoldenCity.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Orazca, the Golden City</h3>
				<p>The grandest ruin of the ancient Sun Empire is Orazca, the glorious golden city where the Immortal Sun still lies hidden. It was the empire's capital for many centuries, and tribute from across the breadth of the empire was brought to adorn its palaces and temples. Gold adorns nearly every building in the city, and jade inlays reflect the influence of the ancient merfolk who shared the city with the humans of the empire. For centuries, the earth was closed up over the golden city, hiding its secrets and its treasures—but now it is opened, and the struggle for control of its power has begun.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/SunEmpireCities.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Sun Empire Cities</h3>
				<p>The Sun Empire dominates the coast of Ixalan with three cities. Atzocan lies on the low coastal plain, nearest the sea. Pachatupa stands where the coastal plains rise into the high mountains. And Otepec is in high alpine forest at the western edge of the Sun Empire’s lands.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/LegionOfDuskOutposts.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Legion of Dusk Outposts</h3>
				<p>As the Legion of Dusk has begun to land on the Sun Coast, they have established forts and colonies on the coastal plains and swampy river mouths. The most important forts there are Adanto (called the First Fort), Durron (the Fort of Faith), and Leor (the Edge of Exile).</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/HighAndDry.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>High and Dry</h3>
				<p>The floating city of High and Dry is neutral ground for the Brazen Coalition. It consists of rafts, barges, ship hulls, and floating platforms lashed together into one large mass. Taverns and shops catering to pirates stand on top. Violence here is commonplace and often goes unpunished.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Creature Races</h2>
			
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/SunEmpire.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Sun Empire</h3>
				<p>The people of the Sun Empire are humans, said to have been formed from the clay by the loving hands of Kinjalli, the Wakening Sun. They live alongside dinosaurs, without taming or domesticating them, but leading them into battle and harnessing them to heavy loads.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/RiverHeralds.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>River Heralds</h3>
				<p>The River Heralds are merfolk—a race of amphibious humanoids at home throughout the oceans, rivers, and rainforests of Ixalan. All merfolk can breathe air or filter oxygen from the water. The green merfolk favor the land, while the blue merfolk are more at home in water.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/LegionOfDusk.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Legion of Dusk</h3>
				<p>The Legion of Dusk is ruled by an aristocratic class of vampires. They are faster and stronger than most humans, with supernatural abilities that made them the most powerful force in their homeland. Now, as they search for the Immortal Sun, they bring this strength to Ixalan.</p>
			</div>

				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/BrazenCoalition.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Brazen Coalition</h3>
				<p>The pirates of the Brazen Coalition are a diverse bunch, including humans from a wide variety of backgrounds as well as members of three nonhuman races: goblins, orcs, and sirens.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/Goblins.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Goblins</h3>
				<p>Goblins are native to Ixalan, but their curiosity drew them to the Brazen Coalition when the pirates first arrived on the Sun Empire’s shores. Though they still thrive in jungle colonies, goblins are commonly seen perched on gunwales and clambering up masts of sleek pirate ships.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/Orcs.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Orcs</h3>
				<p>Orcs have been enemies of the Legion of Dusk since it was originally formed. After centuries of fighting the Legion their numbers have dwindled to only a few hundred. Some still live on remote islands near Torrezon, but many have joined the Brazen Coalition to serve on pirate ships.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/Sirens.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Sirens</h3>
				<p>Sirens settle along rocky coasts, on remote islands, and even on floating piles of kelp. They are mercurial creatures who can turn in an instant from loving to murderous—and back again. They are fascinated with ships, taking positions on ship crews—including, in at least one case, as captain.</p>
			</div>

			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('../Images/JaceBeleren.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Jace Beleren</h3>
				<p>A brilliant telepath with insatiable curiosity, Jace strives to know all there is to know. His skills in illusion, mind reading, and memory modification make him one of the most talented—and potentially dangerous—Planeswalkers in the Multiverse. However, he has arrived on Ixalan with his mind broken after a battle with Nicol Bolas, leaving him without any memory of who he is or his capabilities.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/Vraska.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Vraska</h3>
				<p>The mysterious Planeswalker Vraska wields a suite of deadly spells that suit her gorgon nature. She specializes in assassination, stealth, and petrification—and she likes to take souvenirs. The dragon Planeswalker Nicol Bolas has hired her to come to Ixalan and find the Immortal Sun. Of course, if she fails in this mission, she will be trapped on this plane forever.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('../Images/Huatli.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Huatli</h3>
