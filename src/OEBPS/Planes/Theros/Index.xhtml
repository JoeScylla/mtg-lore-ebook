			<h1>Theros</h1>
			
			<p>Theros is ruled by an awe-inspiring pantheon of gods. Mortals tremble before them, feel the sting of their petty whims, and live in terror of their wrath. It is a plane where barbaric, cave-dwelling minotaurs descend on wayward travelers. Giants stalk the land, drawing strength from the terrain on which they tread. At sea, massive krakens prowl its depths, and sirens lure its sailors to their demise. Yet amid such colossal perils, mortals have found a way to endure, and it is here that the hero's mantle is raised highest.</p>
			<p>Not only have the mortals endured, they have managed to thrive, for Theros is also a plane where civilization is protected behind the walls of great poleis, each city-state a bulwark against the raging monsters that roam the more savage places of Theros. Meletis, the polis of learning, progress, magic, and devotion to the gods, is a testament to the achievements of civilized humanity. It is hemmed in by vast golden wheat fields and the Siren Sea, and defended by the Reverent Army. In the polis of Akros, martial prowess is held in the highest esteem. Akroan warriors have reached near-mythic status throughout Theros. The imposing cliff-top fortress of Akros lies at the center of a network of outposts that serve to protect the rest of Theros, a fact that comforts many Therans. Setessa, the isolated polis surrounded by concentric rings of forest, is fiercely independent. Strong bonds connect its inhabitants, and all in Setessa share a veneration of nature.</p>

				<p>Kydele serves as the primary oracle to Kruphix, Theros's enigmatic god of horizons and mysteries. For Kydele, there is no greater virtue than seeking and facing the truth. From her seat at Kruphix's temple, Kydele has seen truths that would unravel the minds of lesser mortals. Kruphix revealed to Kydele the true nature of the gods and Theros's place in the Multiverse, a sight she can never unsee.</p>

				<h3>Kynaios and Tiro of Meletis</h3>
				<p>A vast region of Theros was once ruled by the tyrant Agnomakhos, an immortal archon. Until one day, Kynaios and Tiro, joined by their love for one another and for freedom, rose to challenge him. The people rallied to their cause, and Agnomakhos was defeated. The polis of Meletis was founded on the ruins as a beacon of freedom and enlightenment, and Kynaios and Tiro became its guardians.</p>

				<h3>Ravos, Soultender</h3>
				<p>As an oracle of Athreos, the god of passage, Ravos knew the fleeting nature of life. Even so, watching his beloved perish in battle was too much for Ravos to bear. He bargained to help Athreos guide the dead to the Underworld in exchange for seeing his dead lover once each year. Now, Ravos plots his beloved's rescue, and secretly defies Athreos by escorting the dead back to the land of the living.</p>

				<h3>Purphoros, God of the Forge</h3>
				<p>Wielding a massive hammer called Akmon, Purphoros oversees chaos and destruction as well as the craftsmanship of unique creations.

			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/ThassaGodOfTheSea.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Thassa, God of the Sea</h3>
				<p>Wielding her legendary bident, Thassa rules the sea and all secret knowledge that has been lost to it. Any who travels by shipâ€”no matter how brief a journeyâ€”must make an offering or risk her displeasure. Though she often appears as a triton, Thassa does not favor them over mortals or other creatures.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Poleis</h2>
			
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/Akros.jpg');"></figure>

			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/Centaurs.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Centaurs</h3>
				<p>The centaurs have formed two distinct bands. The Lagonnas are merchant travelers who peaceful trade and seek to live in harmony with those around them. The Pheres are wandering nomads who raid for what they need and hunt wherever they venture.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/Gods.jpg');"></figure>

				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/Merfolk.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Merfolk (Tritons)</h3>

				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/Minotaurs.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Minotaurs</h3>
				<p>Although they are among Theros's races, for all intents and purposes they are monsters, seeking only mayhem and meat, killing each other when they're not killing humanoids of other races. Brutish and barely sentient, minotaurs do not revere any gods. Their divine guides are destruction, brutality, and bloodâ€”all in the name of conquest and fun.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/Nyxborn.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Nyxborn</h3>
				<p>Created by the gods, nyxborn are a wild assortment of creatures that all contain the essence of Nyx within.

			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/Satyrs.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Satyrs</h3>
				<p>Always in good spirits and eager to celebrate, satyrs welcome all to their festivitiesâ€¦ as long as guests have no desire to leave. Since they see life ending with a journey to the underworld, satyrs choose to spend every second alive in a wild jubilation, needing no other reason then being alive.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/Zombies.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Zombies (Returned)</h3>
				<p>On Theros, anyone who dies goes to the Underworld. But not all stay there. Those who return have found a way to cheat Erebos and escape. In masks of gold, they return to Theros with all their old skills, yet no memory of who they once were.</p>
			</div>

			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('../Images/Kiora.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Kiora</h3>
