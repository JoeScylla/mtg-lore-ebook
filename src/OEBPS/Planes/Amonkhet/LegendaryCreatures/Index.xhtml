			<h2>Legendary Creatures</h2>
			
			<h3>Oketra the True</h3>
			
			<figure><img alt="Oketra the True" src="Images/OketraTheTrue.jpg" /></figure>
			<p>The cat-headed god Oketra embodies stability, order, and protection. She values coordinated purpose and cooperative action. Her trial is the first one undergone by initiates, forcing them to rely on the other members of their crops and stand or fall together.</p>
			
			<h3>Kefnet the Mindful</h3>
			
			<figure><img alt="Kefnet the Mindful" src="Images/KefnetTheMindful.jpg" /></figure>
			<p>With his ibis head and glorious wings, the god Kefnet represents intellect and the magic of the mind. Kefnet oversees the Trial of Knowledge, and judges worthiness based on mental prowess. He believes that knowledge is power and his greatest weapon is his mental acumen and magical ability.</p>
			
			<h3>Bontu the Glorified</h3>
			
			<figure><img alt="Bontu the Glorified" src="Images/BontuTheGlorified.jpg" /></figure>
			<p>Crocodile-headed Bontu is the God of Ambition. Bontu teaches that no one is born strong—they become it. Pride and cunning are tools for self growth. She is closely associated with the process of embalming both the initiates who attain a Glorious Death and those who fall ingloriously along the way.</p>
			
			<h3>Hazoret the Fervent</h3>
			
			<figure><img alt="Hazoret the Fervent" src="Images/HazoretTheFervent.jpg" /></figure>
			<p>Jackal-headed Hazoret is the god of zeal. Hazoret's ideal of zeal encompasses powerful emotions as well as religious intensity. It is not enough to merely want a place in the afterlife, initiates must channel that drive into a furious battle that will determine their final place in the afterlife.</p>
			
			<h3>Rhonas the Indomitable</h3>
			
			<figure><img alt="Rhonas the Indomitable" src="Images/RhonasTheIndomitable.jpg" /></figure>
			<p>Rhonas is the cobra-headed god of strength, both in physical superiority—the ability to exert and withstand force—and mental aspects of willpower. The ability to resist fear, to face battle with indomitable will, and self-reliance are the qualities that ensure success in Rhonas's trial.</p>
			
			<h3>Temmet, Vizier of Naktamun</h3>
			
			<figure><img alt="Temmet, Vizier of Naktamun" src="Images/TemmetVizierOfNaktamun.jpg" /></figure>
			<p>Though he is technically a vizier of Oketra, Temmet's work brings him in contact with all five gods. He is only sixteen years old, but his dedication to Oketra, to solidarity, and to learning has elevated him to a position of supervising the other viziers in charge of the city's infrastructure.</p>
			
			<h3>Hapatra, Vizier of Poisons</h3>
			
			<figure><img alt="Hapatra, Vizier of Poisons" src="Images/HapatraVizierOfPoisons.jpg" /></figure>
			<p>Hapatra is a human vizier who spends most of her time in Rhonas's monument. Her work with basilisks in the Trial of Strength has made her resistant to all kinds of venoms and toxins. She has an affable sense of humor, and uses her good nature and powerful poisons to constantly improve Rhonas' Trial.</p>
			
			<h3>Neheb, the Worthy</h3>
			
			<figure><img alt="Neheb, the Worthy" src="Images/NehebTheWorthy.jpg" /></figure>
			<p>Neheb is a highly accomplished initiate who has earned four cartouches and thus a place in the House of Hazoret. He inspires both fear and respect in all who see him fight. He is a talented charioteer, and his favored weapon is a spear, which he wreathes in magical flame before battle.</p>
			
			<h3>Samut, Voice of Dissent</h3>
			
			<figure><img alt="Samut, Voice of Dissent" src="Images/SamutVoiceOfDissent.jpg" /></figure>
			<p>Samut is an initiate who doubted the legitimacy of the God-Pharaoh. Renowned for her speed and skill in hand-to-hand combat, Samut was a leader in her crop. Secretly, she studied the dance and martial arts of the past, and discovered that her people's history had been wiped from memory.</p>
			
			<h3>The Gods of Destruction</h3>
			
			<figure><img alt="The Gods of Destruction" src="Images/TheGodsOfDestruction.jpg" /></figure>
			<p>Nicol Bolas's gods of destruction. Once benevolent protectors of Amonkhet, Nicol Bolas twisted them into their present forms. Their arrival, foretold in prophecies known as the Hours, promised paradise but delivered apocalyptic chaos.</p>
			
			<h3>The Scorpion God</h3>
			
			<figure><img alt="The Scorpion God" src="Images/TheScorpionGod.jpg" /></figure>
			<p>The Scorpion God is massive and soulless, but is initially greeted with joy by the immortals of Amonkhet. Their revelry is soon demolished as it reveals its purpose: to hunt down and kill each remaining god.</p>
			
			<h3>The Locust God</h3>
			
			<figure><img alt="The Locust God" src="Images/TheLocustGod.jpg" /></figure>
			<p>Next, in the Hour of Promise, the Locust God begins to tear down the Hekma. The god's swarm of locusts fills the sky, blocking out the sun. With the barrier gone, the city is exposed to the threats of the desert.</p>
			
			<h3>The Scarab God</h3>
			
			<figure><img alt="The Scarab God" src="Images/TheScarabGod.jpg" /></figure>
			<p>But that is not the end. The Hour of Eternity arrives with a final scarab-headed god marching into the city, leading ranks of lazotep-coated undead soldiers—the Eternals.</p>
