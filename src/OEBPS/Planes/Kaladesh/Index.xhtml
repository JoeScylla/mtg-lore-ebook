			<h1>Kaladesh</h1>
			
			<figure><img alt="Amonkhet" src="Images/KLD_Mountain_Image_gallery_0.jpg" /></figure>
			<p>The world of Kaladesh is a living work of art, owing its bright existence to the tangible presence of aether. Aether is the raw magical energy that inhabits the space between planes in the Multiverse. While it's nominally present on many planes, on Kaladesh it's a critical part of the ecosystem. The life-giving energy infuses the natural world, sculpting the earth and waterways, drawing trees and plants into delicate twisting patterns, and attracting wild creatures like a magnetic force.</p>
			<p>Ever since the ingenious inventor Avaati Vya developed a process to refine volatile raw aether, it has also been inextricably woven into the world's culture of inspired invention. The Consulate, Kaladesh's governing body, recognized the potential of aether as a fuel and designed distribution methods to ensure that it was accessible to all. Their efforts led to a plane-wide inventors' renaissance, a time of hope, optimism, and boundless creativity. Now, clockwork automotons walk the streets, whirling thopters flit over the markets, and elegant gear-driven mechanisms raise and lower the very streets and buildings of the cities themselves.</p>
			<p>As bright and wondrous as Kaladesh is, it still faces its share of strife. A faction known as the renegades believes that the Consulate is infringing on their freedoms. They refuse to adhere to safety regulations and aether quotas, and they undermine the Consulate's efforts to provide structure and lawfulness. But renegade activity aside, this is a time of celebration. The Consulate has recently announced the Inventors' Fair, a month-long festival to celebrate the myriad inventions of the Great Aether Boom. Airships will race, automaton constructs will battle, genius minds will face-off, and elegant design will reign supreme.</p>
			<p>The head judge of the fair has installed the meticulous and diligent vedalken Dovin Baan as Senior Inspector, and Dovin has promised that the fair will go off without a hitch. He has recently elicited the help of the Gatewatch to mitigate potential renegade threats. Nothing will stop the people of Kaladesh from basking in the brilliance of their genius creations.</p>

				<p>A rarity on Kaladesh, Baral is a mage. The Consulate considers mages to be dangerous and unstable, so Baral keeps his powers secret even as he hunts and arrests other mages. Over a decade ago, he called for the execution of the pyromancer Chandra Nalaar, and was severely burned when she disappeared in a blaze.</p>
			</div>

			<h2>Cities</h2>
			
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/GhirapurCityOfWonders.png.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Ghirapur, City of Wonders</h3>
				<p>The largest city on Kaladesh, Ghirapur is a massive cogwork machine that comes alive with the power of aether. The city extends from the port district of Bomat, located at the confluence of Kaladesh's three major rivers, through a multitude of varied and distinct neighborhoods, including the bustling Eleven Bridges market district, the aviaries of Freejam, the metalworking zone of Weldfast, the cosmopolitan greenbelt of Kujar, and the artist colony known as Giants' Walk. Ghirapur was founded on the spirit of invention, and today it is home to the Consulate government, which strives to uphold the founders' principles of optimism, creative freedom, and hope.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/LathnuCityAtTheTopOfTheWorld.png.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Lathnu, City at the Top of the World</h3>
				<p>Lathnu is a remote settlement in the far north perched high on the Devra Cliffs; it can only be reached via vertical rail track, or a very long and strenuous climb.

			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/PeemaTouchedByAether.png.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Peema, Touched by Aether</h3>
				<p>Spanning tens of thousands of acres, the wild forest of Peema is home to a population of elves who are deeply connected to the flow of aether. Daily, aether streams dip from the aethersphere to wind through the flora and imbue the fauna. The plants and trees are more vibrant in Peema, and the creatures are stronger, faster, and livelier than their counterparts elsewhere on Kaladesh.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/VahdTheGoldenSteps.png.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Vahd, the Golden Steps</h3>
				<p>An expansive region that was once solely devoted to farming, Vahd took on a new identity during the Great Aether Boom, becoming a hub of the aerowright industry. The wheat fields surrounding the villages of Panka, Cambi, and Maranjapur were cleared away to make room for runways, hangars, and workshops, and many farmers trained to become aerowrights and test pilots.</p>
			</div>
			
			<h2>Creature Races</h2>
			
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/Humans.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Humans</h3>
				<p>The humans of Kaladesh are passionate dreamers who strive to achieve the impossible through their inventions. While they are the only race on Kaladesh whose physiology is untouched by the presence of aether, their curiosity and ambition drive innovation, and they excel at synthesizing ideas.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/Elves.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Elves</h3>
				<p>Elves are deeply in tune with the flow of aether and the subtle ways it influences and shapes the natural world. Their inventions are inspired by nature and in turn they inspire others, offering a vision of progress that is elegant, efficient, and harmonious with the Great Conduit's aether patterns.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/Vedalken.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Vedalken</h3>
				<p>The blue-skinned, twelve-fingered vedalken are known for becoming deeply engrossed in the theoretical nature of their inventions. They strive for perfection in design, though they readily admit-and rejoice in the fact-that nothing can be perfect. Instead, they delight in iteration and improvement; they're the innovators of Kaladesh.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/Dwarves.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Dwarves</h3>
				<p>Dwarves believe that the beauty of an invention is almost as important as its function, and nothing is more beautiful than a device that functions perfectly. These meticulous artisans have an unparalleled work ethic. They rely on proven tools and methods, and they relish in the physical process of construction.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/Gremlins.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Gremlins</h3>
				<p>While gremlins lack the hallmarks of a cultured humanoid race, they still play an important role in Kaladesh's society of invention. Driven by their insatiable hunger for aether, they eat through obsolete or defective (or sometimes fully-functional) inventions in order to access the trapped aether within. In this way, they liberate aether back into the environment, allowing it to be used again.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="cmp-list-item">
				<figure style="background-image: url('Images/Aetherborn.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Aetherborn</h3>
				<p>Aetherborn came into being spontaneously as a byproduct of the aether refinement process. Their bodies are in constant flux, as the aether residue they're made of gradually dissolves and is reclaimed by the aethersphere. Thus, their lives are short. But rather than despair, they savor each fleeting moment, squeezing out every last drop of enjoyment.</p>

				<figure style="background-image: url('../Images/LilianaVess.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Liliana Vess</h3>
				<p>Cunning and ambitious, Liliana is quietly growing more powerful by the day. And thanks to a contract with some demons, she's not growing any older. She wields the blackest of magic-necromancy-and is a master of animating the dead.</p>
			</div>

				<figure style="background-image: url('../Images/NissaRevane.jpg');"></figure>

				<figure style="background-image: url('../Images/GideonJura.jpg');"></figure>
				<h3>Gideon Jura</h3>
				<p>Gideon values loyalty and honor above all. He's a tactically minded combat mage with the power of invulnerability, which gives him the edge in almost any battle. A champion for the innocent, he inspires others to follow him in his pursuit of justice.</p>
			</div>
