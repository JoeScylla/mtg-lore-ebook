			<h2>Biography</h2>
			
			<p>Fiercely loyal, unyielding, just, and charismatic, Gideon Jura (known as "Kytheon Iora" on his home plane of Theros) doesn't hesitate to enter combat to defend the innocent. A powerful warrior-mage with the ability to make himself invulnerable, he wields a four-bladed surral and hieromancy magic against his foes. A man of the people, he takes pride in leading his comrades towards the common good.</p>
			<p>Though he is now one of the foremost warriors in the multiverse, Gideon came from humble beginnings, leading a gang of street kids struggling to make a living. Imprisoned by the local guards, he honed his leadership, self-discipline, weapon use, and hieromancy under the watchful eye of the prison warden, Hixus. His newfound strength was put to the test while defending his city. But when he tried to overstep his abilities, he unintentionally doomed the rest of his soldiers. The impact of his failure to protect his own comrades ignited his Planeswalker spark, and he found himself on a new plane, able to begin atoning for his past by dedicating himself to protecting the denizens of the Multiverse from planar threats.</p>
			<p>His quest has lead him the planes of Alara, Ravnica, and Zendikar, where he's encountered powerful Planeswalker allies including the telepath Jace and the pyromancer Chandra, as well as strange, otherworldly foes. . .</p>
