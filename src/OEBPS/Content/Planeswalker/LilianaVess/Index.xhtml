			<h2>Biography</h2>
			
			<p>Beautiful, cunning, and ambitious to a fault, Liliana has mastered the dark art of necromancy. Her spells reanimate the dead and corrupt the living. Ageless and charismatic, she's sharp as the edge of a razor and lives for the pursuit of power.</p>
			<p>Once a noble-born healer on the plane of Dominaria, Liliana Vess first encountered necromancy in an attempt to heal her sick brotherâ€”but she inadvertently doomed him to spend eternity as one of the undead. The terror of death and the pain of her guilt ignited her Planeswalker spark, and she found herself on the plane of Innistrad. More than a century later, Liliana tried to forever remain at the height of her power and conquer death by forging a pact with four of the Multiverse's most powerful demons. The words of this pact remain written indelibly on her skin. But Liliana has never been one for servitude, and she's taken up regaining her freedom by defeating the four who bound her. Her quest for freedom led her to the demonic Chain Veil, which she wrestled from Garruk after cursing him. The Chain Veil amplifies her powers, but at great cost to her health and sanity. With the power of the Chain Veil, she has conquered the first two of her demons, but she still has two others to hunt.</p>
			<p>Liliana's ambition has led her to interact with beings from all over the Multiverse, but ultimately, Liliana's greatest love and first priority is herself. She's convinced that everyone else is in it for themselves too, she's just better at playing the game than they are. . .</p>
