			<h2>Creature Races</h2>
			
			<h3>Humans</h3>

			<p>Of the five humanoid races of Amonkhet, humans are the most diverse and adaptable. Humans train in a wide variety of fighting styles, including those particularly favored by other races. Humans are willing to go to any length, exhausting all available options, to reach the pinnacle of achievement.</p>
			
			<h3>Aven</h3>

			<p>Aven have humanlike bodies, arms, and legs, along with birdlike wings and heads resembling those of hawks or ibises. Aven delight in flying above their foes, using their superior mobility to confound and outpace their opponents.</p>
			
			<h3>Khendra</h3>

			<p>The khenra of Amonkhet are tall and lean, with graceful bodies and heads that strongly resemble jackals. Nearly every khenra is born a fraternal or identical twin, and a pair of khenra twins forms an extremely close emotional bond unknown to most other residents of Amonkhet.</p>
			
			<h3>Minotaurs</h3>

			<p>Minotaurs are powerfully built, barrel-chested humanoids with heads resembling rams. As their appearance suggests, they combine great physical strength with stubbornness, bravado, and almost reckless bravery. They revel in combat, especially when the odds against them seem overwhelming.</p>
			
			<h3>Naga</h3>

			<p>Naga look like enormous snakes with shoulders and arms protruding from humanoid torsos. Naga believe in a principle called the Sweetest Harmony, which describes a perfect balance between the body and the mind. Finding that balance, as they understand it, is a sure path to glory in the trials.</p>
